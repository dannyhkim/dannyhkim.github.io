                            In the Winter of 2019, I had the opportunity to work as a UX/UI Designer at CIBC, one of Canada's largest banks in Toronto. Working in the digital sector of CIBC was very enlightening, and provided me a path to many new learning experiences. During my time at CIBC, I was working on the Dailies team, designing and maintaining consistent experiences across all of CIBC's major online platforms which include CIBC, US CIBC, and Simplii Financial. By utilizing tools such as Adobe Experience Manager and Sketch, I was able to design some new webpages that were to go live on the CIBC site, as well as execute functional, content, and layout changes to existing pages, driving improvements to create a modern, elegant interface and user experience for our banking customers.

                            As a CIBC Digital Co-op, I was also given the opportunity to work with other co-ops, a mentor, and a sponsor on a 4 month-long project to develop a solution for greater growth in client mobile banking adoption. In order to recognize and incentivize clients through our mobile app, we developed a prototype of a rewards platform within the CIBC app that would allow users to earn points by completing simple mobile banking transactions. These points could then be redeemed for various rewards options from which the client could select. After building the prototype and developing a business case, we were able to present our idea to a group of executives at CIBC.

                            These are the high-fidelity mockups I created using Sketch after continuous iteration based on discussions and feedback from my team, mentor, and sponsor. After designing the mockups, I built a clickable prototype using InVision to demonstrate the user flow during our final presentation.
